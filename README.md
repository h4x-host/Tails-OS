- Tailsis a portable operating systemthat protects    againstsurveillance and censorship.
- Shut down the computer and start on your Tails USB stick instead of starting on Windows, macOS, or Linux. Tails leaves no trace on the computer when shut down.
- Tails includes a selection of applications to work on sensitive documents and communicate securely. Everything in Tails is ready-to-use and has safe defaults.
- You can download Tails for free and independent security researchers can verify our work. Tails is based on Debian GNU/Linux.

## Features ‚öôÔ∏è

- use Tails to hide their identities, avoid censorship, and communicate securely.
- use Tails to publish sensitive information and access the Internet from unsafe places.
- use Tails to escape surveillance at home.
- whenever you need extra privacy in this digital world.
- You can temporarily turn your own computer into a secure machine. You can also stay safe while using the computer of somebody else.
- Tails always starts from the same clean state and everything you do disappears automatically when you shut down Tails.
- You can save some of your files and configuration in an encrypted Persistent Storage on the USB stick: your documents, your browser bookmarks, your emails, and even some additional software.
- Everything you do on the Internet from Tails goes through the Tor network. Tor encrypts and anonymizes your connection by passing it through 3 relays. Relays are servers operated by different people and organizations around the world.
